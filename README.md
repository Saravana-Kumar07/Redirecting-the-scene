### CUBE PROGRAM:
```C#
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;
using UnityEngine;

public class CubeProgram : MonoBehaviour
{
    Rigidbody rb;
    public GameObject WinText;
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        if(Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space))
        {
            SceneManager.LoadScene("level2");
        }
    }
    public void OnMouseDown()
    {
        Destroy(gameObject);
    }
    private void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision)
    {
        if(collision.gameObject.tag=="sphere")
        {
            Destroy(collision.gameObject);
            WinText.SetActive(true);
        }
    }
}
```
## OUTPUT:
### SCENE BEFORE THE BALL HITS THE CUBE:
<img src="out1.png" width=650>

### SCENE AFTER THE BALL HITS THE CUBE:
<img src="out3.png" width=650>

### NEW SCENE AFTER REDIRECTING:
<img src="out2.png" width=650>

## RESULT:
Thus, a scene is redirected in Unity engine using a C# program.
